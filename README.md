# Lightscrape

This is a cli I wrote to download a whole book from sites like https://lightnovelpub.vip/. It also works for webnovelpub, novelfire, roomnovel.

## To use:

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure the link you copy is from the main page.
3. Run `bun index.ts` followed by the link you copied.
```sh
bun index.ts https://lightnovelpub.vip/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries-wn-16091313
```

## Todo:

1. make compiling epub easier
2. sort out italics, bold, other markdown parsing.
